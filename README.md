# Data-Science-Project---Diamond-Price-Prediction-Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive data science application that combines machine learning with an interactive web dashboard. It focuses on predicting diamond prices based on various features and visualizing the results.

Key features:
Gradient Boosting Regression model for price prediction
Interactive Shiny dashboard for data exploration and model evaluation
Extensive data visualization including correlation heatmaps, boxplots, and scatter plots
Feature engineering to create new predictive variables
RMSE calculation for model performance evaluation
Comparison of actual vs predicted prices

The application allows users to switch between training and test datasets, explore different visualizations, and understand the factors influencing diamond prices. It serves as a powerful tool for both data analysis and as an educational resource for those interested in data science and machine learning techniques.
